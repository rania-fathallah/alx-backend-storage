# 0x00. MySQL Advanced

## Description

The `0x00-MySQL_Advanced` project focuses on advanced MySQL database management and operations. It covers complex SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, indexing, and database optimization techniques. The goal is to deepen your understanding of relational database management systems (RDBMS) and provide practical skills for working with large datasets and complex database operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and write complex SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
- Implement stored procedures and triggers to automate database tasks.
- Optimize queries using indexing and other performance-tuning techniques.
- Use views for simplified data access and management.
- Understand the importance of database normalization and denormalization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into tasks that cover advanced MySQL features and operations:

1. **Complex Queries**:
   - Learn how to write complex SQL queries with multiple joins, nested queries, and aggregate functions.
   - Practice using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and advanced filtering.

2. **Stored Procedures**:
   - Create and use stored procedures for reusable database logic.
   - Understand parameter handling and control flow within stored procedures.

3. **Triggers**:
   - Implement triggers to automate tasks based on database events (e.g., insert, update, delete).
   - Learn the best practices for using triggers effectively.

4. **Indexing and Optimization**:
   - Use indexing to improve query performance.
   - Learn about query execution plans and how to analyze them for optimization.
   - Understand the trade-offs involved in indexing.

5. **Views**:
   - Create views to simplify complex queries.
   - Understand the benefits and limitations of using views.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0.
- Use `mysql` to run MySQL commands.
- Code should follow best practices for writing SQL scripts.
- Familiarity with basic SQL operations is assumed.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: SQL Query Basics
- Review the basic concepts of SQL.
- Practice writing simple to complex queries using various clauses and functions.

### Task 1: Stored Procedures
- Create stored procedures to perform specific tasks in the database.
- Explore how to call stored procedures with different parameters.

### Task 2: Triggers
- Implement triggers for automatic execution of database tasks based on specified events.
- Practice with `BEFORE` and `AFTER` triggers.

### Task 3: Indexing
- Apply indexing to optimize query performance.
- Analyze query performance with and without indexing.

### Task 4: Views
- Create views to represent subsets of data from one or more tables.
- Simplify data retrieval using views.
