# NoSQL Project

This project is part of the ALX curriculum and focuses on understanding and working with NoSQL databases. Specifically, it explores MongoDB, one of the most popular NoSQL databases, and aims to demonstrate how NoSQL databases differ from traditional SQL databases. Youâ€™ll learn about their structures, benefits, and the practical applications for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental differences between SQL and NoSQL databases.
2. Define and explain NoSQL data models, including key-value, document-based, column-family, and graph databases.
3. Use MongoDB for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
4. Work with basic queries, collections, and indexing in MongoDB.
5. Integrate MongoDB with Python using `pymongo`.
6. Understand use cases and advantages of NoSQL databases for high-volume, distributed data storage.
