# ALX Backend Storage

## Description

The `alx-backend-storage` project focuses on understanding and working with various backend storage technologies, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and caching systems. The goal is to learn how to design, implement, and interact with different types of storage solutions for backend systems, and to understand when to choose one type of storage over another based on specific use cases.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the differences between relational and NoSQL databases.
- Use SQL to interact with a relational database.
- Use NoSQL to interact with a non-relational database.
- Understand the purpose of caching and how to implement it.
- Learn about different storage engines and their advantages.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different tasks that cover the major backend storage technologies:

1. **Relational Databases**:
   - Learn how to create, modify, and interact with tables using SQL.
   - Understand database normalization and relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).
   - Practice complex queries with joins, unions, and nested queries.

2. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Learn the basics of NoSQL and how it differs from relational databases.
   - Work with key-value stores, document stores, or other NoSQL database types.
   - Understand use cases where NoSQL is a better choice than relational databases.

3. **Caching**:
   - Implement caching mechanisms to optimize data retrieval times.
   - Understand different caching strategies (e.g., LRU, LFU).
   - Learn how to use caching frameworks or services.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.x.
- Code should follow the PEP8 style guide.
- Install all required packages and dependencies before running scripts.
- Familiarity with database management systems (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.) is recommended.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 0: Setting Up a Relational Database
- Install a relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Create a database and configure access.

### Task 1: SQL Practice
- Create tables and define relationships using SQL commands.
- Write complex SQL queries to interact with the database.

### Task 2: Setting Up a NoSQL Database
- Install and configure a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
- Learn how to perform CRUD operations in a NoSQL environment.

### Task 3: Caching Data
- Implement caching using a framework or service (e.g., Redis).
- Practice setting expiration times and managing cache keys.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Relational Database Setup**:
   - Install MySQL or PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install mysql-server
     # or for PostgreSQL
     sudo apt-get install postgresql
     ```

2. **NoSQL Database Setup**:
   - Install MongoDB or another NoSQL system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
     ```

3. **Caching Setup**:
   - Install Redis for caching:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install redis-server
     ```
